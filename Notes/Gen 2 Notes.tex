\subsection*{Vectrex}

\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection*{General facts}
\item Released in US 1982 at \$199, wasn't released until 1983 in Europe and Japan
\item Originally made by General Consumer Electric then bought out by Milton Bradley
\item Video Game Crash of 1983 shortly after release meant it wasn't around for long

\subsubsection*{Technology}
\item Unlike other consoles of the 2nd generation, it didn't connect to the TV but had its own built in vector CRT (and speakers)
\item First and only home console to be based on vector graphics. Vector displays were already popular in arcade machines.
\item Like the Magnavox Odyssey, the Vectrex used plastic overlays to display background images and add colour to its monochrome display
\item Games were stored on cartridges, like many of the other consoles of its generation

\end{itemize}



\section*{Industry}

\subsection*{Video Game Crash of 1983}

\begin{itemize}

\item The video game industry crashed around 1983 due to too many consoles and games as well as the growing popularity of home computers
\item High profile yet low quality games on the successful Atari 2600 such as a port of Pac-Man and the infamous E.T. The Extra Terrestrial contributed to triggering the crash due to the huge losses made and by losing the trust of retailers
\item Small companies quickly went out of business as a result

\end{itemize}
